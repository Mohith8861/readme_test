## Introduction

Eduverse is an innovative desktop application designed to help users create, manage, and share personalized learning roadmaps for any skill they wish to acquire. Whether you're learning to code, play an instrument, or master a new language, Eduverse simplifies the process by providing structured roadmaps, resource management, and social sharing capabilities. Built with generative AI at its core, Eduverse empowers users to learn smarter, not harder.

## Problem Statement

Learning a new skill can be overwhelming. Many learners struggle with:

- **Lack of Structure**: Not knowing where to start or how to progress.
- **Resource Overload**: Overwhelming amount of resources present all over the internet. Difficulty in organizing and managing learning materials.
- **Motivation**: Losing track of progress and feeling demotivated.
- **Collaboration**: Limited ability to share resources or follow others' learning paths.

Eduverse addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform where users can create structured roadmaps, attach resources, track progress, and collaborate with others all powered by generative AI to make the process seamless and intuitive.

## Features

### 1. **Create Custom Roadmaps**

- Users can create detailed roadmaps for any skill, breaking it down into modules and topics.
- Example: A roadmap for learning Python could include modules like "Basics," "Data Structures," and "Web Development," with topics like "Variables," "Lists," and "Flask Framework."

### 2. **Edit and Update Roadmaps**

- Users can easily modify and update the contents of their roadmaps to reflect their learning progress.
- Example: Add a new topic, reorder modules, or mark a topic as completed.

### 3. **Resource Management**

- Attach resources (PDFs, videos, links) to specific modules or topics.
- Example: Attach a YouTube tutorial to the "Flask Framework" topic or a PDF eBook to the "Data Structures" module.

### 4. **Automatic Google Drive Integration**

- Users can share resources, they are automatically uploaded to Google Drive, and sharable links are stored in the database.
- Example: Share a resource with a friend by generating a Google Drive link.

### 5. **Social Sharing**

- Share your roadmaps and resources with others or follow roadmaps created by other users.
- Example: Follow a roadmap created by an expert in machine learning or share your own roadmap for learning guitar.

### 6. **Progress Tracking**

- Track your learning progress and stay motivated.
- Example: Mark topics as "In Progress" or "Completed" and visualize your progress with a progress bar.

### 7. **Internet Resource Recommendations**

- Eduverse can fetch and recommend relevant links from the internet for the user's convenience by scraping the Bing search engine.
- Example: If a user creates a roadmap for "Machine Learning," Eduverse can recommend top-rated courses, tutorials, and articles from the web.

## How It Works

### 1. **Generative AI for Roadmap Creation**

- Eduverse uses OpenAI's GPT to suggest modules and topics based on the skill the user wants to learn.
- Example: If a user wants to learn "Digital Marketing," the AI generates a roadmap with modules like "SEO," "Content Marketing," and "Social Media Advertising and their relevant topics all in the format of the course object."

### 2. **Resource Upload and Sharing**

- When a user clicks on share resource, the app will request the permissions to access the user's google drive and upon agreeing, it authenticates and fetches the access and refresh token( which are stored on users device for future use).
- Once tokens are fetched, the resource file is uploaded to Google Drive via the Google Drive API.
- A sharable link is generated and stored in the database for easy access.

### 3. **Progress Tracking**

- Users can mark topics as "Not Started","In Progress" or "Completed," and the app updates the progress bar in real-time.

### 4. **Social Collaboration**

- Users can browse shared roadmaps, follow them, and access the attached resources.
- Example: A user can follow a roadmap for "Web Development" and access all the resources shared by the creator.

### 5. **Internet Resource Recommendations**

- Eduverse uses web scraping to fetch relevant links from Bing based on the course or skill name.
- Example: For a roadmap on "Data Science," Eduverse can recommend links to freeCodeCamp tutorials, Coursera courses, and Medium articles.
